// start.js
// Combined entry point: runs the Forever RP API and the Discord bot
// in a single Node.js process. Use this when you only want (or can only
// afford) ONE hosted service — e.g. a single Render Web Service — instead
// of a separate API service + background worker.
//
// Run with: node start.js
// (or: npm run start:all)
//
// Why this works: Render (and most PaaS providers) require a Web Service
// to bind to the assigned $PORT. The bot itself doesn't need a port — it
// connects out to Discord's gateway — so by loading both in the same
// process, Render sees the API's app.listen() as the "web service" while
// the bot quietly runs alongside it in the background.
//
// This entry point ALSO re-registers all slash commands with Discord on
// every boot, so you never have to manually run `npm run deploy` on hosts
// (like Render) where you don't have easy shell access — add/rename/remove
// a command file, push, and the next restart picks it up automatically.
